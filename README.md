## How to use/install

If you cannot host this or don't want to use your own system, please view the [Cloud9 Install Tutorial (For Beginner Users)](https://github.com/LifeMushroom/Modular-Node.js-IRC-Bot/blob/master/Docs/Cloud9.md) or the [OpenShift Install Tutorial (For Experts)](https://github.com/LifeMushroom/Modular-Node.js-IRC-Bot/blob/master/Docs/OpenShift.md) otherwise, continue on...

1. Open ```settings.js``` and configure the file. There are comments in the file that should tell you what to do.
2. Install Node.js. Go in a command prompt and navigate to the bot's folder.
3. Run ```npm install``` to automatically install [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) and [daemonize2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/daemonize2)

To start your bot, type ```node main.js``` or alternatively, open ```run.bat``` on Windows. Otherwise, to run it as daemon, run ```node app.js start```.

Your bot should be on the desired channel.
